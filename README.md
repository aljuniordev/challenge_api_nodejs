In this project I am using:

- Clean architecture
  > The architecture that I most enjoy using at the moment, it gives me a lot of freedom at the same time that I manage to have a very good organization for testing
- Typescript
  > Just because! Ever! hahaha... because it guarantees me much more reliability in the code among many other reasons
- Swagger
  > For documentation
- Tsyring
  > For dependency injection and to facilitate library independence
- Express
  > To facilitate me the http settings - Helmet for more security and ease of setup
- Helmet
